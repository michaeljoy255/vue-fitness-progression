## Use Case Problem Solving (Define core use cases!)

`Need to fix classes before continuing!`

- Change init and data checking to getters for the stores
- How to handle **empty** instances? (use null, don't use empty classes)
- Unit tests for the classes!

`Dashboard Defaults Card`

- Show card if store is loading and data is empty

`Dashboard Resume Card`

- Show card is store active workout record is found

`Workout Cards`

- Loaded from workouts if they are found

`Active Workout Page`

- Custom nav bar (no timer right now)
- Design how exercises will appear
- Create active workout record local storage data

## Additional Tasks

- Use Luxon for dates and times
- Add custom Error classes
- Add static "is..." instance of methods to certain classes
- Add getArray() and set(data) methods to containers
- Change `Recommendations` to something else (rename sub components)?
- Tests for classes, utils, and services (attempt components later)
- Date and timer components / functions?
- DashboardSummaryCard
