# vue-fitness-progression

## Todos / Tasks

- Define core use cases!

- App state initialized on startup
  - Load state data from storage
- When to display ResumeCard
  - If activeWorkoutRecord exists in state
- When to display DefaultsCard
  - If exercises and workouts don't exist in state
  - How to prevent from showing breifly while data is being fetched?

## Time Permitting

- Initial and placeholder tests for classes and more
- Views
  - Build out core View designs (based on old app)
- Components
  - Finalize DefaultAppBar and WorkoutAppBar
  - Date and timer components / functions?

## Logic to Consider

- DefaultsCard should only display if no workouts AND exercises are found

## Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
