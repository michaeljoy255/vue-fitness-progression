## Core Tasks for MVP

1. Work on ActiveExercise inputs (display and function)

   - `multipleSets` (only show set buttons if this input exists)
   - `weight`
   - `reps`
   - `duration`
   - `distance`

1. Only have the ActiveRecord get saved when you click Finish Workout for now

1. Save to the state and LS during every input blur most likely

1. Display previous exercise performance by each input

## Additional Tasks

- Use try..catch at component level to provide useful errors for users
- Use Luxon for dates and times
- Add custom Error classes
- Date and timer components / functions?
- DashboardSummaryCard
- Vetur path/dir aliasing with jsconfig.json and Webpack
- Validation of bad values in class constructors at some point?

## Database (Firebase, IndexedDB, Local Storage, etc.)

- exercises
- workouts
- historyExerciseRecords
- historyWorkoutRecords
- activeWorkoutRecords
- activeExerciseRecords

## App Store (Vuex, Redux, etc.)

- Combination of Database and Active Data
- Only load data into store as needed

## Class Relationship Lists

- ExerciseInput
- ExerciseSet
- \_Entity
  - \_Record
    - WorkoutRecord
    - ExerciseRecord
  - \_Activity
    - Exercise
    - Workout

## Components that may be needed

- Response (for storage, promises, and more?)
- Storage Adapters (classes?)
- Timer
- WorkoutTimer
- StaticTime
- WorkoutSummary

## Unimplemented

- Distance
- Height
- Weight
- Exporter
- ExporterSummary
- Importer
- MeasurementRecord

## Exporter Output

```javascript
{
  exporterSummary: {
    appVersion: Number,
    exporterVersion: Number,
    createdAt: Date,
    totalCategories: Number,
    totalEquipment: Number,
    totalWorkouts: Number,
    totalWorkoutRecords: Number,
    totalExercises: Number,
    totalExerciseRecords: Number,
    totalMeasurementRecords: Number,
  },
  categories: [],
  equipment: [],
  workouts: [],
  workoutRecords: [],
  exercises: [],
  exerciseRecords: [],
  measurementRecords: [],
}
